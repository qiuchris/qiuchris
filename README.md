## Hi, I'm Chris ğŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Currently, I'm studying at [the University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) as a third year Computer Science ğŸ’» student. I like working with Java and TypeScript, and in my free time you can find me sleeping ğŸ’¤. I'm also working on a few personal projects in the background...

Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn on the left sidebar! ğŸ˜Š

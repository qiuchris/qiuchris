## Hi, I'm Chris 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Currently, I'm studying at @UBC as a second year Computer Science 💻 student. I like working with Java and TypeScript, and in my free time you can find me sleeping 🛏️💤. I'm also working on a few personal projects in Java.

Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn on the left sidebar! 😊
